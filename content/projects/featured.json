    "description": "I'm a self-taught sketch artist with a love for capturing emotion through minimal mediums. I specialize in charcoal portraits, focusing on facial detail, expression, and realism. Each sketch is a reflection of patience, depth, and perspective, qualities that echo in my coding journey as well. Art has taught me mindfulness, attention to detail, and creative flow. I consider it not just a hobby but a vital part of my identity. In this space, I'll be showcasing some of my favorite works.",
